# list-counter
This allows a list of items to be made and searched, and for users to click a button to add one to the count of items.

This is useful, for example, if you have a friend who tells the same stories repeatedly. Then you can make a list of the stories, and people can click on the story each time they hear it.

## Deployment
This is deployed using terraform to AWS.
